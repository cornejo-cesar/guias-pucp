## Footnotes

Here is an inline note.[^1]

[^1]: Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.

Here is a footnote reference,[^2] and another.[^3]

[^2]: Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.

[^3]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

    ```         
    { some.code }
    ```

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.
